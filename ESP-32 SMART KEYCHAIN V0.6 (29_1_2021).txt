ESP-32 SMART KEYCHAIN V1.0 (23_2_2021)
UPDATES:
1) Replaced 0.96 inch OLED screen with 2.9 inch e-paper display
	Removed pins: 21 & 22 [PREV USED FOR SDA & SCK RESP FOR OLED]

2) Added GPIO pins for e-paper display:
	-BUSY:	32
	-RST:	23
	-DC:	27
	-CS:	19
	-CLK:	18
	-DIN:	5

3) Replaced ESP-32 Devkit with ESP-32 Breakout Board

4) Added Voltage divider circuit for Battery measurement:
	-from Vcc-> 64K Ohm -> 24.1K Ohm -> Gnd
	-GPIO 34 connects to the point between 64K and 24.1K to read adc measurement

5) E-paper display now displays all the information NEATLY
	-Kural Number
	-Fav/Not a Fav
	-Adhigaram Number
	-Adhigaram
	-Kural Line 1
	-Kural Line 2
	-Explanation Lines 1-7
	-Date / Time in 12hr format / Time in 24hr format
	-Battery Percentage / Battery bars [Example: ||||, -|||, --||, ---|, Battery Dead]

6) Bluetooth functionality now has added features:
	-Can set the time from Phone
	-Get the kurals read and at what time







~~~~~~~~~V0.6~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATES:
1) Added NEW GPIO Pin: GPIO 33 for the LED Notification in BT mode

2) BT functionality now has added LED notification. This has been enabled by GPIO 33. Here are the LED's modes:
	- LED off when not in BT usage at all
	- LED Blinking mode when trying to connect to a Device.
	- LED stable (always ON) when connected device.
	- LED back to off state when BT Disconnect
	- GPIO is set accordingly to functionality [ON/OFF, DELAYS, etc.]


~~~~~~~~~V0.5~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATES:
1) Added NEW GPIO Pin: GPIO 25 for the OLED Screen
2) OLED screen is now powered by GPIO 25
	- which is HIGH AFTER BOOT & BEFORE I2C (forOLED) is initialized
	- which is low only when Keychain goes to Deep sleep mode
	- which is made HIGH again after Deep sleep's SOFT RESET [DEEP SLEEP RESET IS HERE ON CALLED SOFT RESET]

3) REMOVED: Reading Thirukkural text file

4) Added 1330 thirukkural as switch case instead [Speed very significantly increased]

5) Added a Reverse Countdown Timer Starting from 6 to 1.
	- 6,5,4,3,2,1,Deep sleep
	- Any button toggle resets timer
	- BT MODE disables timer


~~~~~~~~~V0.4~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATES:
1) Added 1000 switch case [FOR TESTING NOT ACTUAL THIRUKKURAL]
	- Message able to be read on OLED Screen

2) void print_what_saved() is now called only once thus only 1 x 1000 switch case [PREVIOUSLY 3 SWITCH CASES]

3) Favourites button now mentions as:
	- "~~~~~Favourite~~~~" or
	- "~Not a Favourite~~"

~~~~~~~~~V0.2~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATES:
1) Button 14: Added as FAVOURITES BUTTON
	-Fav button can toggle ON and OFF on same switch.
	-Any message can be made Favourite (or removed) at any point.

2) ANY BUTTON can WAKEUP keychain from Deep sleep.

3) Fixed all TIMER related errors thereby eliminating SOFTWARE PC HARD RESET. Only resets available are:
	- Deep Sleep Reset (which is default when ESP32 recovers from ULP and goes to main)
	- Manual Restart button to restart keychain (if and when required)
	- BT disconnect which refreshes BT connection and restarts.

4) Out of bounds error corrected

5) BT name changed to "SMART KEYCHAIN"

6) Fixed Button Delays:
	- All Buttons (left, right, favs, sleep on & wakeup from any button) refined to a 'USER LEVEL' (almost instantaneous)
	- BT on made must be pressed and held for 2 seconds
	- BT wake from same button

7) BT disable button added (from Button 4 only) [PREVIOUSLY: BT disconnect only from User phone]

8) Developoment Analytics:
	- All Button Counters refined for Serial monitoring values (i.e. they look neat now !)
	- BT mode passes values of all button counters on PROFILE A & all favourites saved on PROFILE B (for APP Interaction)

MINOR FIX: Fixed 'Current Message' Error [Wrong message was displayed]

~~~~~~~~~V0.1~~~~~~~~~~
GPIO used: 26, 13, 14, 2, 21, 22, (4)

Button Left: 26
Button Right: 13
Button NOT USED: 14
Button Sleep/Wake/BT: 2
SDA (OLED): 21
SCL(OLED): 22
4: Gnd (To prevent ESP from accidental wake from floating high)

Button Features:
Button Left: Prev message + Restart timer
Button Right: Next message + Restart timer
Button Sleep/Wake: Sleep + Wake + HOLD FOR 2 SECONDS for BT activate 

Features:
2 modes available: Learning Mode (on start/default), BT mode (for app connect)

1 Auto Sleep after 6 seconds according to code [actual: 6.6 seconds]
2 Timer resets after every button press(Except BT)
3 BT mode is activated after holding button 4 for 2 seconds
4 BT mode disables timer temporarily
5 BT can get message of Button press count from ESP Server
6 BT disconnect event goes back to button press state for keychain & timer starts too
