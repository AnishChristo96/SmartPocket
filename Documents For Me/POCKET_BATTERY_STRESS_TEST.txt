										BATTERY STRESS TESTS

1. SMART KEYCHAIN (BREADBOARD_3)

TIME OF START:		2:25pm
V. of Battery @ start:	4.14 V

Time Period of ESP Wake:	6s
Time Period of ESP Sleep:	5s
Status @ start:			ESP erase flashed, Starting from Kural 1
Kurals:				In english

Description: The stress test is aimed at checking the BREADBOARD setup's power usage/battery performance. The ESP is flashed to new [i.e. it starts from Kural 1] condition and battery is
added to the setup. Battery is recharged to full capacity and measured @ 4.14 V. The test program involves the ESP to display a kural and wait for 6 seconds before deep sleeping. Then it 
sleeps for 5 seconds & wakes up. Here the VOLTAGE REGULATOR (LD33) WAS USED.

RESULT:

Kural reached:		965
Stopped time:		5:23 pm
Total time run:		~3 hours
V. of Battery @ stop:	3.65 V
Result Description:	very bad
